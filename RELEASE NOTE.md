# c64rework releases

## v0.9.1

- KB (knowledge base) watches now never follow CPU I/O map, bank must be ram
(the default) or color (to watch values in color ram).
- REVM compares gained vic, cia1 and cia2. Before, only SID registers were
checked at the compare ritual (along with KB watches and the visual frame).
The compares only look at config registers, not full state of the chips.
The All() shorthand was added vic, cia1 and cia2 so it now properly checks
all chip config.
- rework script now requires exact VERSION match.
